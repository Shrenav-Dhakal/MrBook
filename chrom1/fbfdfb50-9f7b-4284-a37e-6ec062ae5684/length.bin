As of Unicode 7.0, less than 3%\nof all code points are assigned to characters.\nIn the Python documentation, the term\nmay be spelled as one or two words. For ex\u2010\nample, in Chapter 2, \u201cBuilt-in Functions,\u201d\nof the Python Library Reference, the chr\nfunction is said to take an integer \u201ccode\u2010\npoint,\u201d while its inverse, ord, is described as\nreturning a \u201cUnicode code point.\u201d\ncode smell\nA coding pattern that suggests there may be\nsomething wrong with the design of a pro\u2010\ngram. For example, excessive use of isin\nstance checks against concrete classes is a\ncode smell, as it makes the program harder\nto extend to deal with new types in the fu\u2010\nture.\ncodec\n(encoder/decoder) A module with func\u2010\ntions to encode and decode, usually from\nstr to bytes and back, although Python has\na few codecs that perform bytes to bytes\nand str to str transformations.\ncollection\nGeneric term for data structures made of\nitems that can be accessed individually.\nSome collections can contain objects of ar\u2010\nbitrary types (see container) and others on\u2010\nly objects of a single atomic type (see flat\nsequence). list and bytes are both collec\u2010\ntions, but list is a container, and bytes is\na flat sequence.\nconsidered harmful\nEdsger Dijkstra\u2019s letter titled \u201cGo To State\u2010\nment Considered Harmful\u201d established a\nformula for titles of essays criticizing some\ncomputer science technique. Wikipedia\u2019s\n\u201cConsidered harmful\u201d article lists several\nexamples, including \"Considered Harmful\nEssays Considered Harmful\u201d by Eric A.\nMeyer.\nconstructor\nInformally, the __init__ instance method\nof a class is called its constructor, because\nits semantics is similar to that of a Java con\u2010\nstructor. However, a fitting name for __in\nit__ is initializer, as it does not actually\nbuild the instance, but receives it as its self\nargument. The constructor term better de\u2010\nscribes the __new__ class method, which\nPython calls before __init__, and is re\u2010\nsponsible for actually creating an instance\nand returning it. See initializer.\ncontainer\nAn object that holds references to other ob\u2010\njects. Most collection types in Python are\ncontainers, but some are not. Contrast with\nflat sequence, which are collections but not\ncontainers.\ncontext manager\nAn object implementing both the __en\nter__ and __exit__ special methods, for\nuse in a with block.\ncoroutine\nA generator used for concurrent program\u2010\nming by receiving values from a scheduler\nor an event loop via coro.send(value).\nThe term may be used to describe the gen\u2010\nerator function or the generator object ob\u2010\ntained by calling the generator function. See\ngenerator.\nCPython\nThe standard Python interpreter, imple\u2010\nmented in C. This term is only used when\ndiscussing implementation-specific behav\u2010\nior, or when talking about the multiple\nPython interpreters available, such as PyPy.\nCRUD\nAcronym for Create, Read, Update, and De\u2010\nlete, the four basic functions in any appli\u2010\ncation that stores records.\ndecorator\nA callable object A that returns another call\u2010\nable object B and is invoked in code using\nthe syntax @A right before the definition of\na callable C. When reading such code, the\nPython interpreter invokes A(C) and binds\nthe resulting B to the variable previously as\u2010\nsigned to C, effectively replacing t
